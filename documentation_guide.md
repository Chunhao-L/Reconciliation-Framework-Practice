‚úÖ Documentation Structure Overview
You can create the documentation in a Word doc, Confluence page, SharePoint, Markdown files in Git, or even as a Data Catalog. Here‚Äôs a recommended structure:

üìò 1. Executive Summary
Purpose of the Document

Brief overview of what this document covers: e.g., data ingestion, staging, auditing processes.

Target Audience

Data analysts, BI developers, data engineers, QA, etc.

üìÇ 2. System Architecture Overview
Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Include a visual flow from RAW_LAYER ‚Üí STG_LAYER ‚Üí AUDITING.
Tools: Draw.io, Lucidchart, or simple Visio.

Overview of Layers

Layer	Purpose
RAW_LAYER	Stores raw ingested data from JSON batch extracts
STG_LAYER	Structured staging tables for parsed customer/product data
AUDITING	Holds reconciliation results (summary + detail) for data quality checks

üß± 3. Table Documentation
For each table (e.g., RAW_LAYER.ENTITY_EXTRACT, STG_LAYER.CUSTOMERS, etc.), create a section like this:

üìÑ Table: STG_LAYER.CUSTOMERS
Column Name	Data Type	Description
batch_id	INT	ID of the batch this record came from
entity_event_id	INT	Unique ID for the event (RAW_LAYER entity)
customer_id	INT	Business key for customer
fname	NVARCHAR(50)	First name parsed from JSON
lname	NVARCHAR(50)	Last name parsed from JSON
gender	NVARCHAR(1)	Gender field

Add a brief paragraph describing what this table represents and how it is populated.

üîß 4. Stored Procedure Documentation
For each procedure, document in this structure:

üìå Procedure: STG_LAYER.LOAD_STG_CUSTOMERS_AND_PRODUCTS
Item	Description
Purpose	Parses customer and product data from RAW_LAYER.ENTITY_EXTRACT and inserts into STG_LAYER.
Run Frequency	Daily / On-demand
Input	Implicit: Reads from RAW_LAYER.ENTITY_EXTRACT
Output	Populates: STG_LAYER.CUSTOMERS, STG_LAYER.PRODUCTS
Key Logic	- Extracts JSON fields with JSON_VALUE()
- Filters on entity_type
- Performs incremental load via MAX(batch_id)
Assumptions	JSON schema in raw data remains stable
Error Handling	None ‚Äî should be handled by ETL orchestration

Then include:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Procedure Code: STG_LAYER.LOAD_STG_CUSTOMERS_AND_PRODUCTS
-- Full SQL here (with inline comments)
üîç 5. Reconciliation Logic Documentation
This part should explain how data quality checks are being implemented:

üìå Procedure: AUDITING.LOAD_RECONCILIATION_OVERVIEW
Compares record counts and batch IDs between RAW_LAYER and STG_LAYER.

Uses metadata from AUDITING.RECONCILIATION_REFERENCE to dynamically build reconciliation logic.

Results stored in AUDITING.RECONCILIATION_OVERVIEW.

Describe logic for:

Batch ID count comparison

Record count comparison

Match/Mismatch determination

Audit job metadata (e.g., audit_id, audit_job_id)

üìå Procedure: AUDITING.LOAD_RECONCILIATION_DETAIL
Identifies missing records from staging (not found in raw).

Uses LEFT JOIN logic with metadata-driven dynamic SQL.

Helps QA teams identify data loss.

üß™ 6. Testing & Validation Plan
Document the test cases you used to validate procedures:

Record count match

JSON parsing accuracy

Incremental load working

Reconciliation mismatches properly logged

Example test scenarios and expected output.

üß∞ 7. Operational Guidelines
How to run each procedure manually

Sample execution:

sql
Copy
Edit
EXEC STG_LAYER.LOAD_STG_CUSTOMERS_AND_PRODUCTS;
EXEC AUDITING.LOAD_RECONCILIATION_OVERVIEW;
Who is responsible for monitoring?

üìù 8. Change History
Version	Date	Author	Change Summary
1.0	2025-07-16	You	Initial documentation for staging/auditing

üìå Final Tip:
Keep the documentation modular and version-controlled. You can break it into multiple files or pages:

01_Tables.md

02_Procedures.md

03_ReconciliationLogic.md

Also consider integrating this documentation with tools like:

Data Catalogs (e.g., Alation, Azure Purview)

Git repositories

Confluence or Notion for wider team visibility
